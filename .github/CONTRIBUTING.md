Contributing to the project
=======================

## Guidelines
1. **Don't break the build**
2. **Search before making a new issue, pull request, or commit**: Someone might have already done what you wanted to do.
3. **Test, test, and test**: Test your changes before you commit, or pull request.

## Issues
#### Before creating a new issue make sure to...
* Check if the issue you are reporting hasn't already been reported.
* Check that your issue exists in the latest files from the development branch.
* Check that you're not using modified files.
* Check that the issue is reproducable.

## Pull Requests
* If your pull request fixes an existing issue then be sure to associate your pull request with the issue.
* It is recommended that changes are committed to a new branch on your fork. Avoid directly editing the `development` or `main` branch. This practice helps prevent merge conflicts if changes are committed to the `development` or `main` branch ahead of your pull request being merged. See [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo/) and [creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/).
